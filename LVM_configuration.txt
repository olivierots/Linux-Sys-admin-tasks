####################  LVM  ####################
LVM (Logical volume management) allow multiple disks to be combined together and its software based.
one disk ===> create a volume group (associated with one disk) LVM SW
         ===> then you could have as many partitions as you want e.g home, swap, system, var etc.  

say you have 3 disks of 100G (combined together) ==> create a vol. grp (size of the grp become 300GB) 
                                                 ==>  then you create diff logical vol. e.g data1, data2, date3
whats the advantage of LVM ? you could add another disk to your volume group and extend it without breaking it.
This is very useful in a corporate environment because as a sys-admin guy, when other teams such as dev usually
always ask for more space /disks to add more capacity to a system.


####################  LVM config & instalation on oracle VM   ####################
# create a new VM on oracle VM with centos 7 (thats what i am using) provided you have an ISO file etc.
# choose your desired hostname  
# leave the network settings turned off 
# custom partition config:  select this -> click on the disk then i will configure partition myself ->  click done 
                            use the LVM parition scheme -> click ont he plus sign -> add some points (in my case i've added       
		            /home with as desired size: 2g -> you can modify your group name to anything you want
			    created more partitons /var with 2G,/swap with 1G & /boot & 500M -> then for the rest of the disk
           		    just pick / & all under desired capacity -> confirm the configs, click done & accept your chnages                            pick xfs as a file system type -> leave label empty.

# choose a username + password etc. and reboot your machine, once rebooted, please login 
# df -h ==> will show all the paritions you've created (i cant copy / paste from this VM as it wont let me for some reason)

					
####################  add disk and create LVM partition   ####################
create LVM new disk partitions 
1. create HDD ==> every HDD need a partition on top of it 
2. create partitions
3. create a physical volume for each partitions
4. create a vol group (this represent the entire vol grp for that disk)
5. create a logical volume
6. mount the LV to our file system 

##### STEPS ######
# go to your settings from oracle V. box -> storage -> controller -> add new disk then create new HDD -> pick a name you like
  create -> boot up the system. 
  
# login as root 

# fdisk -l 
  The 3rd disk will have sdc, 2nd sdb and 1st is sda with all their respective size  
  
# fdisk /dev/sdc ==> create the partition, click n, then p, and the rest just hit enter to pick the default value
                     under command (m for help): click t -> l -> and choose lvm which should be 8e -> hit p to confirm
                     then w to sync the disks
					 
# pvcreate /dev/sdc1 ==> create the physical volume and the part. number which is 1
# pvdisplay ==> verify with this and it will tell you the vol details, physical vol. size etc. 
# vgcreate <your_desired_vol_grp> /dev/sdc1  ==> create a volume group 
# vgdisplay <your_desired_vol_grp>
# create your logical volume
  lvcreate -n <logical group name> --size 1023 <volume_grp_name> 
# lvdisplay ==> display your LV info 
# format the disk & assign the file system to the partition 
  mkfs.xfs /dev/<vol_grp_name>/<logical_vol_grp> 

# mount it 
mkdir /new_dir 
mount /dev/<vol_grp_name>/<logical group name>  /new_dir
# verify with df -h to see your partitions and moint points etc. 
# if you want to mount this partition at boot time then edit the /etc/fstab file and add the follwing
  config at the bottom of the file:
  /dev/<vol_grp_name>/<logical group name>/<new_dir> xfs defaults 0 0

# notes:
error encountered: group file system cant be of type lvmlv 
anything with /dev/mapper means its mounted on LVM


####################  extend disk using LVM  ####################
why do we need to extend a disk ?
when this disk becomes full for example  for /oracle =1.0G is full, you have a few options such as 
the below: 
# delete older files to free up disk space 
# add a new physical disk and mount it to /oracle2 
# or create a new virtual disk and mount it to /oracle2 
# or extend /oracle through LVM 

###### in this case we are going to extend the disk using LVM  ######
# under settings -> storage -> add new disk under controller -> then give it whatever size you need 
# log in & become root
# do a df -h ==> have a look at the partion you're trying to extend (the one with 100%)
# fdisk -l /dev/xxx ==> check the new disk is there (in my case its /dev/sdd)
# fidsk /dev/sdd  ==> partition your new disk 
# fdisk -l | more ==> you should see /dev/sdd1 created 
# reboot the system so its updated 
# fdisk -l /de/sdd1 ==> make sure its there 
# pvdisplay or pvs ==> shows which grp its assiciated to  (VG name) 
# vgdisplay <group_name>
# pvcreate /dev/sdd1 ==> create the physical vol
# vgextend <vol_group> /dev/sdd1 ==> extend it now & associate to sdd1
# lvextend -L+1024M /dev/mapper/<vol_grp>/<lv_grp>  ==> specify the size
# xfs_growfs /dev/mapper/<vol_grp>/<lv_grp> ==> extend the file systems


####################  extend the swap space   ####################
# whats swap ? 
used when the amount of physical RAM is full, its not a replacement for more RAM 
its a virtual mem. that comes form your HDD, its recommended that swap space is twice the size of RAM

# cd / && ls -ltr ==> your new file should be created here 	(newswap)										   									  
# why didnt we create the file ourselves ? we wanted to take away some chunks from our disk and dedicate to or file
                                           which we cant do with touch 
# chmod go-r newswap ==> remove read perm. for g & o as we dont want others to read the file  
# mkswap /newswap 
# swapon /newswap ==> turn on the swap, tell the OS that this is the new swap 
# free -m ==> check whether the size of your swap has been increased 
# vi /etc/fstab ==> enable swap space during boot time 7 add the below line 
  /newswap    swap    swap defaults  0    0
# reboot your system ==> init 6
# delete the swap if needed or done with your testing ...
swapoff /newswap 
rm /newswap & remove the config from fstab
