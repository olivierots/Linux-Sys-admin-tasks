####################  DNS     ####################

DNS stands for domain name system 
DNS is a system that is used to translate hostname to IP addresses (and vice versa) 
Every computer system has an IP address and human beings cant remnber them because its so cumbersome 
to fix that issue, hostnames / letters came up which computers dont understand, computers only undertsand digits 
DNS does this translation for us 

### DNS record ###
A DNS record is simply a database that maps human-friendly URLs to IP addresses. 
When someone types in a URL such as google.com, that entry is sent to an internet
service provider (ISP) where it'is forwarded to the DNS servers, and then directed
to the proper web server using the corresponding IP address as a label.

Hostname to IP ==> A records
IP to hostname ==> PTR records 
Hostname to hostname ==> CNAME records 

config files:
/etc/named.conf ==> main DNS conf file, package is called bind
/etc/name ==> dir that contains all the zone files 
service ==> named

########   download,install & configure your DNS server - instructions   ###########
# create a snapshot of your machien first just in case you make a mistake in your configs 
# set up: Master DNS, slave DNS and a client 

### step 1: Instalation 
# use the follwing comamnd to install the DNS packages as root (i already have it) ==>yum install bind-utils -y 
[root@olivier-linux-server Linux-SysAdmin]# rpm -qa | grep -i bind
bind-license-9.11.4-9.P2.el7.noarch
bind-libs-9.11.4-16.P2.el7_8.2.x86_64
bind-export-libs-9.11.4-9.P2.el7.x86_64
bind-libs-lite-9.11.4-9.P2.el7.x86_64
bind-libs-lite-9.11.4-16.P2.el7_8.2.x86_64
bind-utils-9.11.4-16.P2.el7_8.2.x86_64
rpcbind-0.2.0-49.el7.x86_64
bind-export-libs-9.11.4-16.P2.el7_8.2.x86_64
bind-license-9.11.4-16.P2.el7_8.2.noarch
bind-9.11.4-16.P2.el7_8.2.x86_64

# [root@olivier-linux-server Linux-SysAdmin]# ip a | grep -i inet  ==> make sure you know your IP 
  inet 192.168.1.85/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global noprefixroute dynamic enp0s3
# [root@olivier-linux-server Linux-SysAdmin]# ping -c1 www.google.com ==> also make sure you have access to the web 
  PING www.google.com (216.58.205.36) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from mil04s24-in-f36.1e100.net (216.58.205.36): icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=7.99 ms

1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.995/7.995/7.995/0.000 ms  

### Step 2: configuration 
# its a good practise make back up copy of the DNS config file before changing anyhting 
# vi /etc/named.conf ==> edit the DNS config file 
  change this config ==> listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; }; and add your machine's IP as per below 
  listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.85; };
  secondly,
  edit zone 
  zone "." IN {
        type hint;
        file "named.ca";
  change it to: 
  zone "lab.local" IN {
        type master;
        file "forward.lab";
        allow-update {none; };
  };
   zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
      type master;
      file "reverse.lab";
      allow-update { none; };
  };
 		
  "lab.local" is the domain thats i've picked to be the DNS domain 
  forward resolve hostanmes into IPs (forward lookup) and reverse does the opposite (reverse lookup)  

# [root@olivier-linux-server etc]# cd /etc/named
[root@olivier-linux-server named]# touch forward.lab reverse.lab
[root@olivier-linux-server named]# ll
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 May 14 03:08 forward.lab
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 May 14 03:08 reverse.lab
 
# [root@olivier-linux-server named]# vi forward.lab ==> modify the forward zone file and copy the content below 
# research the internet for the meaning of every entry in this file 
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA masterdns.lab.local. root.lab.local. (
     2011071001 ;Serial
     3600 ;Refresh
     1800 ;Retry
     604800 ;Expire
     86400 ;Minimum TTL
)
@    IN NS	   masterdns.lab.local.
@    IN A 	   192.168.1.29

masterdns      IN A 192.168.1.85
clienta   IN A 192.168.1.240
clientb   IN A 192.168.1.241

# the masterdns IP is our IP address 
# every time you make a chnage to this file the serial No has to be updated 
# clienta & clientb do not exist but i've added them them for testing puposes 
  whether i could resolve them when done with the config

add the below config to the reverse.lab zone file 
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA masterdns.lab.local. root.lab.local. (
2011071001 ;Serial
3600 ;Refresh
1800 ;Retry
604800 ;Expire
86400 ;Minimum TTL
)
@ IN NS masterdns.lab.local.
@ IN PTR lab.local.
masterdns IN A 192.168.1.85
158 IN PTR masterdns.lab.local.
240 IN PTR clienta.lab.local.
241 IN PTR clientb.lab.local.

### start the service ###
systemctl start name.d 
systemctl enable name.d
systemctl stop firewalld     ===> dont do this in a prod env. (this a test lab @home) 
systemctl disable firewalld

# configuring permisison for the DNS config files 
chgrp named -R /var/named
chown -v root:named /etc/named.conf 

# test DNS configs
named-checkconf /etc/named.conf ==> no output ? then all ok
named-checkconf /etc/named/forward.lab
named-checkconf /etc/named/reverse.lab

# add DNS server info to the network file 
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3 ==> this is my network interface config file 
add DNS=<Your_Ip> after the last line 

modify the /etc/resolv.conf  ==> default gateway address is here 
nameserve:x.x.x.x ==> add your machine IP here (this is your new DNS server) 

# systemctl restart network ==> restart your network service
# use your DNS lookup utility to test your config is working with the "dig" or "nslookup" command 
dig  <hostname> and dig <IP>
nslookup <hostname> and nslookup <IP>

# restart your DNS service to revert back to your original configs
